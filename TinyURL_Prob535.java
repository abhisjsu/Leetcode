TinyURL_Prob535 is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl
and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL_Prob535 service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode
algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a
URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.*/

public class TinyURL_Prob535 {


        // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        public String encode(String longUrl) {

            return "";
        }

        // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        public String decode(String shortUrl) {

            return "";
        }

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec = new Codec();
// codec.decode(codec.encode(url));
}
